### Stacks And Queues

Fast Operation, Fast Peek, Ordered, but slow lookup

Linear Data structure Unlike array and linked list we have only push and pop

Having limited feature on data structure then it makes them limited to their jobs

### Stacks (LIFO, Last in First out)
Array is not suitable for stacks, we keep adding item on stacks then array my need to relocate on memory


### Queues (FIFO, First in First out)
Don't use array to built queues if we remove item from queue then all items in array needs to be shifted also same to stacks

### Stacks and Queues Cost
Lookup O(N)

Pop/Enqueue (1)

Push/Dequeue (1)

Peek O(1) - (View top item)
