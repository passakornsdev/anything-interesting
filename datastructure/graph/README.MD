### Graph

Each item is called Node (Vertex), node connects with edges

Use cases:

Facebook uses for social network, AWS uses for recommendation engine, Google Map uses determine shortest path

Directed Graph is one way to go, Twitter uses it, when you follow someone then that person does not follow you back

Undirected Graph is like highway, like friend on facebook, they are connected

Weighted Graph, google map uses weighted graph to decide what is shortest path, calculating optimized path

Cyclic (Circle), are really common

Acyclic (One Direction) no way back

Pros:

Relationships, some data means to be in graph form, there are algorithm around graph such as finding shortest path

Cons:

Scaling is hard, but you don't need to create one yourself, use neo4j
