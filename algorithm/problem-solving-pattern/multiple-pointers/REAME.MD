# Multiple Pointers
create pointers and move toward beginning, ending, middle depend on condition

efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity

### Example problem
Find pair of negative and positive number in array which has sum value of 0

// Found 2, -2 + 2 = 0

[-3, -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8] = [-2, 2] 

// Found none

[-3, -2, 0, 4, 7] = undefined
